# Data-Driven Analysis of Mortality Rates and PYLL with Python: Collaborative Medical Study
Collaborated with a medical expert on an extensive mortality database analysis project. This involved extracting essential data, including decease dates, causes, and individual details. I designed and implemented a Python codebase to methodically process the raw database information, transforming it.

Note that this is just a preview the whole project has 101 causes of death in the year of 2020 and 102 in the year of 2021 for TUNISIA.
